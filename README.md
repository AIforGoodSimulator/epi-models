## Epi-models
Epi models used by the simulator from the Crisis Modelling development team.

This repository contains the models adopted by the Crisis Modelling team for infectious disease modelling in Humanitarian Settings (in particular refugee/IDP camps) and first of which for COVID-19 modelling starting from April 2020. Here the models are brought together under standardised API and open sourced for others to better model infectious diseases in different settings they operate in. The Crisis Modelling team uses this package in the Simulator web tool that they develop for other humanitarian actors to use.
